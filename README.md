## CS 39AA Notebook 01: Course Overview and Python Intro

This first notebook is broken into two main parts. The first part is intended to
serve as a brief exploration of some of the NLP tools/concepts we cover in this
course. The second part is a short introduction to Python, which is the initial
step needed to eventually work with those tools/concepts.
